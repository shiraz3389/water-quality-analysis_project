# Water Quality Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes water quality data collected from streams across Israel. Using machine learning models, we identify patterns in water quality parameters, evaluate station compliance with environmental standards, and predict compliance using supervised learning techniques.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values.
- Feature engineering with compliance categorization.
- Clustering using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
- Classification models including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.
- Detailed evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
